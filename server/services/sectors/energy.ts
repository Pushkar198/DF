Analyze these energy departments:
- Renewable Energy (Solar, Wind, Hydro, Biomass)
- Traditional Power (Coal, Natural Gas, Nuclear)
- Energy Storage (Batteries, Grid Storage, Pumped Hydro)
- Grid Management (Smart Grids, Transmission, Distribution)
- Energy Efficiency (LED Lighting, Smart Appliances, Building Automation)
- Oil & Gas (Petroleum Products, LPG, CNG)

Consider these energy factors for ${region}:
- Government renewable energy policies and subsidies
- Industrial and residential power consumption patterns
- Peak demand during summer (AC load) and winter heating
- Grid stability and power outage frequency
- Rural electrification and distributed generation needs
- Energy costs and tariff structures
- Environmental regulations and carbon emission targets
- Technology adoption rates (EV charging, rooftop solar)
- Monsoon impact on hydroelectric and solar generation
- Energy import dependency and security concerns

Return exactly 10 energy demand predictions in this JSON format:
